# Student Health Program – OOP Python Project

This project analyzes student health data from two different schools (A and B).  
Each school provides the following information:

- Number of students  
- List of ages  
- List of heights  
- List of weights  

### The program performs the following tasks:

1. **Stores the data** of each school using an OOP structure (`StudentClass`)
2. **Calculates the average** age, height, and weight for each class
3. **Prints the averages** in the same order as input
4. **Compares the two schools** using the following rules:  
   - The class with a higher **average height** wins  
   - If heights are equal, the class with **lower average weight** wins  
   - If both height and weight averages are equal → prints `Same`

### Technologies Used
- Python 3  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project demonstrates class design, data processing, and decision-making in Python.
